Bug Reporting for David Marini

Bug-Reports: I found several bugs in my teammate’s code. I have detailed them below by card test.

Adventurer: Adventurer was the first card I started with and was the most challenging. The adventurer card my teammate refactored causes the program to core dump. 
This doesn’t happen immediately. My unit test passes, but my random test doesn’t. This is because my random test calls adventurer 10,000 times. 
Around the 300 time, the game core dumps and adventurer fails. I couldn’t determine what was the cause, but a series of print test statements 
determined that the code failed on line 18, with the if statement “if (state->deckCount[currentPlayer] <1)”. Other than this issue, the card function 
also failed before the core dump. The treasure count is never incremented to trigger the test to determine if the player gained two extra treasure. 
Interestingly, I have print statements testing the treasure count, and every time the function declares that the treasure count is incremented, I printed out a 
statement saying that draw treasure was incremented and how much it was currently. But the treasure count as part of the game state is never increased.

Smithy: This card function fails for the handCount. The handCount is increased by 4 instead of 3. 

Great Hall: This card function fails for the numActions. The card is supposed to give you an extra action, however my teammate’s 
function never increments the numActions, and the numActions remains exactly the same. There is one test that the card function passes; 
the card function does draw another card into the player’s hand.
